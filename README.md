## Chess Tier: Replace your chess.com Elo with a Tier!

## How it works
Chess Tier replaces the Elo of yourself and your chess.com opponents with the equivalent rank in the using a tiered rating system.

There are currently 5 tiers, each with 4 to 5 subtiers.
- 🔔 Bronze
- 🥄 Silver
- ⚜ Gold
- ⚔️ Platinum
- 💎 Diamond
- 👑 Champion

Your tier is calculated by taking your chess.com Elo for the specified time control and mapping it to a tier based on the <a href="https://www.chess.com/leaderboard/live">global distribution</a> of player's Elos for that time control. I chose tier mappings using a <a href="https://twitter.com/blaustoise/status/1125821120035221504/photo/1">goldilocks distribution</a>, in order to get tiers similar to <a href="https://www.esportstales.com/league-of-legends/rank-distribution-season-9">those used in Overwatch, League of Legends, and Dota</a>.

You can also turn on the "use USCF ratings?" toggle to get a tier that is based on the Elo rating distribution of US Chess Federation players instead of chess.com players. For this option, I did my best to translate chess.com Elos into USCF Elos using <a href="https://chessgoals.com/rating-comparison/"> this comparison study from chessgoals.com.</a> I used <a href="https://www.chess.com/forum/view/general/a-few-statistics-from-the-uscf-database">2014 USCF rating distribution data</a> to determine the proper tiers. Note: changed settings will not take effect until you reload the page.
